# Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction using ResNets

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) to predict the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy based on retinal images. 
Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and early detection is crucial for timely treatment and prevention of vision loss.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of retinal images obtained from diabetic patients. Each image is labeled with the severity of diabetic retinopathy, typically classified into multiple stages ranging from mild to severe.

## Approach
The main steps involved in this project are as follows:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for training, including resizing images, data augmentation, and normalization.
2. **Model Architecture**: Design and implement a ResNet-based deep learning architecture for image classification.
3. **Training**: Train the model using the prepared dataset, optimizing for accuracy and generalization.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance and fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.
